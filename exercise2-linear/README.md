## PSYC 272: Computational Approaches to Visual Abstraction
### Technical Exercise \#2

This exercise is adapted from [Stanford's CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/):

#### Procedure:

1. Read Stanford CS 231n course notes on linear classification and optimization. Ask questions and discuss concepts with your neighbors as you go through the material.
 - Intro to linear classifiers: http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/
 - Intro to optimization and gradient descent: http://cs231n.github.io/optimization-1/
 - Review of image classifiers (knn): http://cs231n.github.io/classification/

2. Download assignment starter code by cloning this repo or downloading as zipped folder.
- Copy/move/re-download CIFAR-10 dataset to `/exercise2-linear/psych272cava/datasets/`. 
- Launch jupyter notebook server from the `exercise2-linear` directory.
- Submit assignment files by 4pm on 10/28 via file upload on Canvas, replacing `yourname` with your UCSD AD username.
   - `psyc272-cava-svm-yourname.ipynb`
   - `psyc272-cava-softmax-yourname.ipynb`
   - `linear_classifier.py`
   - `linear_svm.py`
   - `softmax.py`

**Note:**
There are START OF YOUR CODE & END OF YOUR CODE tags denoting the start and end of code sections you should fill out. 

This code has been tested to be compatible with python version 3.7. You will need to make sure that during your virtual environment setup (managing your python environment using conda is recommended) that the correct version of python is used.
